Central Tendencies are very useful in Handling the missing values in a dataset

Mean :- Missing values in a dataset can be replaced with "mean" value,if the data is uniformly distributed.

Median :- Missing values in a dataset can be replaced with "median" value,if the data is skewed(tircha).

Mode :- Missing values in dataset can be replaced with "mode" value,if the data is skewed.Missing categorical 
                  values can also be replaced with mode value
 


				5.Measure of Variability  :------
                     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

Range :- The range is the difference in the maximum and minimum values of a data set. The maximum is 
                    the largest value in the dataset and the minimum is the smallest value. The range is easy to calculate but it is 
                      very much affected by extreme values.

			Range = maximum - minimum

Variance :- Variance is a measure of how for each number in the set is from the mean and therefore from every 
                      other number in the dataset.


                     Sample variance(s*s)=∑(xi - μ)(xi - μ) /n

                        s*s =Sample Variance
			xi = the value of the one observation
			μ= the mean value of all observation
			n = the number of observations
